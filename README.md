Authentication section: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/3/project/unilyfe-21080/authentication/providers

(currently enabled google sign-in and email/password sign-in. Microsoft sign-in is a little too complicated, so we might have to substitute it with email/password sign-in, which is why I enabled that option)
